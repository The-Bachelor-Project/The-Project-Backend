In June 2016, Investore entered into a sale and purchase agreement to acquire 14 Countdown supermarkets from Shopping Centres Australasia Property Group Trustee NZ Limited (the SCA Acquisition). Settlement of six properties occurred on 12 July 2016, with the other eight properties expected to settle in September 2016. Investore's investment strategy is focused on Large Format Retail property assets.
