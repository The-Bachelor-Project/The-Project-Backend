The company provides KRAZATI, an oral targeted treatment option for adult patients with KRAS G12C-mutated locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung (NSCLC), as well as in clinical development as a monotherapy and in combination with other agents. It also develops Sitravatinib, an investigational spectrum-selective kinase inhibitor in Phase 3 clinical development that inhibits receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), including TAM family receptors, split family receptors, and RET, which overcomes resistance to checkpoint inhibitor therapy through targeted reversal of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment that enhances antigen-specific T cell response and expanding dendritic cell-dependent antigen presentation. In addition, the company pipeline comprises the MRTX1719, an investigational synthetic lethal PRMT5 inhibitor designed to target the PRMT5/methylthioadensoine (MTA) complex and is in clinical development; MRTX0902, a selective SOS1 inhibitor that improves anti-tumor efficacy in combination with targeted mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-pathway inhibitors, and is in clinical development; and MRTX1133, an investigational lead KRAS G12D compound. It has a collaboration and license agreement with BeiGene, Ltd. to develop, manufacture, and commercialize sitravatinib; and Zai Lab Ltd. to research, develop, manufacture, and commercialize adagrasib in various indications.
