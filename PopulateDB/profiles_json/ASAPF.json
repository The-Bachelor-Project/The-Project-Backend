The company offers interspinous process lumbar fusion devices, such as the ZIP, ZIP ULTRA, ZIP LP, and ZIP-51 for patients suffering from degenerative disc diseases; and Ti-Coated polyether ether ketone interbody cages, which provide spacing and stability between the vertebrae while bone grows to complete the fusion process. It also provides sterile-packed titanium plasma spray coated spinal infusion implants for bone growth, as well as interbody products, such as EOS, VOX, Echo, Echo SD, and EchoXL for the lumbar section of the spine, and discovery for cervical procedures. In addition, the company provides SOLO, an anterior lumbar interbody fusion 3D printed stand-alone fusion device, which is an integrated plate and spacer system that helps to preserve the natural anatomic profile while providing spinal column support and stability; and SiLo, a posterior fusion device for the sacroiliac joint. Further, it offers DEXA-C, a cervical interbody system, which is a porous 3D-printed intervertebral body fusion device that incorporates low-, mid-, or high-density lattice pattern options to support the matching of patients' bone quality.
