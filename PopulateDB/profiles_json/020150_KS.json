Its elecfoils are used as core material for electronic products. The company offers I2B that creates the anode current collector of lithium secondary battery; and IHT, a high bending low illuminance elecfoil for FPCB; and UTC, a very thin elecfoil developed suitable for microcircuiting, high density, high integration, and high multilayering of PCBs. The company also provides I2K, an elecfoil used as a negative electrode collector for small lithium secondary batteries; VLP, a special elecfoil with low illuminance and high strength characteristics used for integrated circuit packaging substrates for semiconductor mounting; ICS, a general-purpose product used as the main material for printed circuit board and copper clad laminate; and I2S to expand the capacity of the secondary battery. In addition, it offers ISS a higher tensile item that is being considered for application of next-generation secondary batteries; HVLP elecfoil suitable for high-speed transmission; and TRT/HRT elecfoils used for base station antennas. The company was formerly known as ILJIN Materials Co., Ltd.
