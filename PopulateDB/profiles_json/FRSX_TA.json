The company develops in-line-of-sight vision solutions and beyond-line-of-site accident-prevention solutions. It offers QuadSight automotive vision solution, a four-camera multi-spectral vision solution that combines two sets of stereoscopic infrared and visible-light cameras for obstacle detection; DynamiCal, an automatic calibration software solution to ensure that stereo cameras remain calibrated to create accurate and continuous 3D depth perception; and ScaleCam, a separated stereo camera solution. The company also provides Percept3D, a 3D point cloud solution that provides 3D raw data for obstacle detection, terrain analysis, and autonomous vehicle sensor fusion; and Mono2Stereo, a solution that enhances existing vision sensor systems by using software-based algorithms to create a 3D perception stereo vision solution. In addition, it offers Eye-Net Protect, a cellular-based V2X solution that provides real-time pre-collision alerts to road users, such as pedestrians, cyclists, scooter drivers, etc. by using smartphones. The company's solutions are also used in defense, autonomous vehicles, and agriculture and heavy industrial equipment. It has a strategic cooperation agreement with FLIR Systems, Inc. to develop, market, and distribute the QuadSight vision system. The company was formerly known as Asia Development (A.D.B.M.)
