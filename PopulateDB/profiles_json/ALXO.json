The company's pre-clinical program focuses on the development of ALTA-002, a SIRPa TRAAC that offers ways to engage the innate and adaptive immune response to cancer. ALX Oncology Holdings Inc. has collaboration agreements with Merck for a Phase 2 trial evaluating evorpacept in combination with pembrolizumab with and without chemotherapy in patients with head and neck cancer; Zymeworks on a Phase 1 trial for the treatment of HER2-expressing breast cancer and other solid tumors; Tallac Therapeutics, Inc. for the development of a potent immune activator targeted to myeloid cells in the tumor to promote innate and adaptive anti-cancer immune responses; and the Quantum Leap Healthcare Collaborative to sponsor and manage a Phase 1 trial to evaluate evorpacept in combination with fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive and HER2-low breast cancer. It also has license agreements with Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University, Selexis SA, and Crystal Bioscience, Inc., as well as collaboration agreement with Sanofi to evaluate Evorpacept in combination with SARCLISA.
