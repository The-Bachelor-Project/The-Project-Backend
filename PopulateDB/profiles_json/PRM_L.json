The company offers SysQuant provides comprehensive analysis of protein activity across regulatory and signaling pathways; TMT MS2 for analyzing cells and tissues when no phosphopeptide enrichment is required; and TMT MS3, a method for biomarker discovery in plasma and other complex samples where quantitative accuracy is the important factor. It also provides TMT Calibrator that analyzes diseased or treated tissue in parallel with peripheral fluids; TMT SRM, a targeted assay format that enables the rapid validation of biomarker candidates; and SRM assay, a targeted mass spectrometry assay format for the routine measurement of biomarkers. In addition, the company offers bioinformatics tools, including Proteome Discoverer for peptide sequence and TMT quantitation; SQuaT,CalDIT, and DIANA for normalized quantitative values and functional annotation at peptide and protein level; FeaST for visualization of data quality, class identifier model, and biomarker candidate lists; and FAT for identification of biological processes and cellular components showing variance. It primarily serves pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and academic research institutes. The company was incorporated in 1993 and is based in Cobham, the United Kingdom.", "companyOfficers": [{"maxAge": 1, "name": "Dr. Mariola  Sohngen", "age": 61, "title": "CEO & Exec.
