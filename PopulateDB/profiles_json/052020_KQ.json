Its platforms include STGlyTarget that is used for the identification and development of immunomodulatory proteins; Immunomodulator Discovery Platform, a proprietary technology to screen for immunomodulatory proteins; Glyco-Specific Antibody Development Platform, a technology designed to screen for antibodies that selectively mask specific sites of target proteins; and Glyco-Specific Antibody Characterization and Optimization Platform, a technology designed to optimize characteristics exerted by antibodies that mask specific sites of target proteins. The company's product pipeline consists of various anti-cancer drugs, including programmed death ligand 1, a type of protein, which is expressed in cancer cells and interferes with the natural tumor killing of immune cells; programmed death-1, a type of protein that is expressed in T cells; and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4, a protein that inhibits the activity of T-cells that can kill cancer cells. Its product pipeline also comprises lymphocyte-activation gene 3, a type of protein, which exists in the cell membrane of immune cells, such as T-cells and NK cells. The company was formerly known as Schem Co., Ltd. and changed its name to STCube, Inc. in April 2008.
