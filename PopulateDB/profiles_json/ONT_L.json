The company offers MinION, a portable device for deoxyribonucleic acid and ribonucleic acid sequencing; GridION, a flexible and self-contained benchtop nanopore sequencer, running and analyzing up to five MinION or Flongle flow cells; MinION Mk1C for basecalling and data analysis, touchscreen operation, and wireless connectivity; Flongle, an adapter for use in MinION or GridION devices to attach a Flongle flow cell; GridION Mk1; PromethION 2 Solo and PromethION 2, a low-cost access to high-yield PromethION sequencing; PromethION 24 and PromethION 48 benchtop nanopore-based sequencers for multiple users to deliver multi-sample and multi-experiment sequencing results; and VolTRAX, an USB-powered device, which automates laboratory processes upstream of nanopore sequencing. It also provides MinKNOW, a software that offers data acquisition, real-time analysis and feedback, local basecalling, and data streaming; Basecalling tools to determine the identity and order of bases on the DNA/RNA molecule; EPI2ME, a cloud-based data analysis platform for end-to-end analysis of nanopore data in real time; and EPI2ME Labs, a bioinformatics solution to assist users in developing their skills and confidence in the analysis of their nanopore-based sequencing data. In addition, the company is developing MinION Mk1D; Ubi; Plongle; and SmidgION products. It sells its products online. The company was formerly known as Oxford NanoLabs Limited and changed its name to Oxford Nanopore Technologies Limited in May 2008.
