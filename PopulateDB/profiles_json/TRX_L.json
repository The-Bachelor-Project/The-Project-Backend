It operates in three segments: dCELL, BioRinse, and GBM-V. The company provides dCELL technology, a soft tissue decellularisation process that removes DNA and other cellular material from animal and human soft tissue to repair diseased or damaged body parts; and BioRinse technology, a natural bone filler solution for osteoinductivity to stimulate and regenerate native bone growth. It also offers DermaPure, a decellularised dermal allograft for reinforcement, repair, and replacement of damaged or inadequate integumental tissue and other homologous uses of human integument; and SurgiPure XD, a decellularised porcine dermal reconstructive tissue matrix for the repair of hernias and body wall defects. In addition, it provides OrthoPure XT, a scaffold to replace the damaged tissue that will re-populate with the patient's own cells; ConCelltrate 100, a verified osteoinductive bone matrix; MatrixCellect 100, a demineralised bone matrix (DBM) for orthopaedic; Matrix IQ Dermis, a human-derived dermal graft, which is decellularised to remove cellular components and preserve the biological properties that promote revascularisation, repair, and augmentation of damaged tissue; and Matrix OI FlexIt, a thin pliable demineralised cortical allograft bone sheet. Further, the company offers DentalFix, a mineralized particulate allograft that offer osteoconductive properties of natural bone; Matrix OI 100 DBM for non-structural bone-grafting; Matrix OI Strips and Blocks, a stem cell containment human scaffold; AmnioWorks to optimise membrane defects; and sports medicine products.
