(Cayman), through its subsidiaries, manufactures and sells epitaxy-based compound semiconductor epitaxy wafers to the electronics and optoelectronics industries worldwide. The company utilizes its proprietary real-time in situ growth monitoring technology on molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) systems for the manufacturing of epi-wafers on gallium arsenide (GaAs) and indium phosphide (InP) substrates. Its GaAs-based products include pseudo-morpic high electron mobility transistors and MHEMT products; and InP-based products comprise hetero-junction bi-polar transistors, HEMT, RTT, and RTD. The company also provides Sb based products, such as type II SLS photodetectors, GaAsSb-base InP HBT, and epi-ready GaSb substrates; and mismatched Epi products comprising III-V on Si, III-V on Ge, and high in content InGaAs on Si. In addition, it offers optoelectronics, including avalanche photodiodes, lasers, high-speed high-frequency surface-emitting lasers, optical receivers, quantum well-infrared photodetectors, modulators, and quantum cascade lasers, as well as infrared light detectors. The company was founded in 1999 and is headquartered in Richardson, Texas.", "fullTimeEmployees": 81, "companyOfficers": [{"maxAge": 1, "name": "Dr. Yung-Chung  Kao", "title": "Chairman, Pres & CEO", "exercisedValue": {"raw": 0, "fmt": null, "longFmt": "0"}, "unexercisedValue": {"raw": 0, "fmt": null, "longFmt": "0"}}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Mr. Qi  Wang", "title": "Chief Financial Officer", "exercisedValue": {"raw": 0, "fmt": null, "longFmt": "0"}, "unexercisedValue": {"raw": 0, "fmt": null, "longFmt": "0"}}], "maxAge": 86400}}], "error": null}}
