The company operates in Life Science Research Tools and Covid Testing segments. It offers MinION, a portable device for DNA and RNA; GridION, a flexible and self-contained benchtop nanopore sequencer to run and analyse up to five MinION or Flongle flow cells; MinION Mk 1C, a nano pore-based sequencer with analysis software and connectivity for self-contained and portable sequencing; Flongle, an adapter for MinION or GridION that enables DNA sequencing or cDNA sequencing on smaller and single-use flow cells; and PromethION 2 Solo, a sequencer for two PromethION flow cells. The company also provides PromethION 2, a self-contained benchtop nanopore sequencer; PromethION 24, which provides single or multiple users with access to terabases of sequencing data; PromethION 48, a sequencing device with high-output flow cells; VolTRAX, an automated library prep for nanopore analyses; and Q-Line, a sequencing for applied applications, as well as products for SAR-Cov-2 testing. Its platform enables its customers to perform scientific/biomedical research in a range of areas, including human genetics, cancer research, outbreak surveillance, environmental analysis, pathogens/antimicrobial resistance, microbiome analysis, and crop science. The company was formerly known as Oxford NanoLabs Limited and changed its name to Oxford Nanopore Technologies plc in May 2008.
